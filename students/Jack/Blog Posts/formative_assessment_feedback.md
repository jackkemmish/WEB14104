#Formative Assessment Feedback
From completing this presentation, I had recieved some feedback from my peers and the lecturer, mostly benefiting my development in this project.

I firstly presented my recipe which we had been coding in HTML and CSS. I had presented the process of my working, and told the class that I had not used Skeleton.css for this, and had been told by a numerous amount of the class to try and impliment it into my bad website re-design.

Then I provided information for the bad webiste I had chosen to re-design, and I had touched upon there being a lack of functionality and layout for users to get the most out of the site, and for the company to gain more clients. The class had agreed with my reasons for choosing this site.

The wireframes I presented were created on Mockflow, a website designed to create various types of wireframes for numerous platforms. The first set of wireframes I showed only had filler text (lorem ipsum) and filler images, ones that came with the application. I was then given feedback to re-design the wireframes to add real content, i.e. text from the original site and images from the original site to allow a better understanding of how the site will look with real text.

After recieving this feedback, I will start to use skeleton to create the functionality of the site and meet with the owner of the company allowing him to get an idea of how the site will be used. The site will be responsive and easy to use on mobile devices, reducing the clutter, making it more accessible for users.

If the functionality is successful and is appreciated then I can start to design it.
If however the functionality is not successful, I will redo the flow of the site, getting feedback off of the owner and a random user as to how they find the use and ease of finding the information they want.

Finally, I then recieved feedback on my presentation skills. I was told that I was clear when speaking and explained points well, however my slides were too cluttered, making the class a bit restless and at parts uninterested. From this I will aim to use just key words on a slide or aim to talk about one thing per slide.
