#Webdesign Myths
There are many myths that cloud over webdesign such as 'People don't scroll', 'Design has to be orginial', or 'The homepage is your most important page'. My favourite myth has to be 'White space is wasted. For many years I have been taught that too much white space on a site is useless and not needed, it reduces a users attention. However, in the mast few months my mind has been swayed more into believing that white space isnt all that bad.

I have wokred with a few companies doing some design work, and have always been told to reduce white space as much as possible. I have always listened to their requests, however sometimes I did not agree due to it seeming to clutered on the pages. I have always lead to believe that users can not be bothered to scroll much on pages, and so it is important to try and keep the information on your page close to the top, allowing users to concentrate. The idea of 'People don't scroll' pops up here too. I again feel that this is not the case; especially now that many websites are inclluding some cool features when users scroll down the page. Moving back to the main idea of white space, I feel now that it adds more clarity to a site, making it easier for users to read the information instead of it being all blocked together.

###What is white space
White space is essentially the margins and padding on a site, the space around the graphics, images and text, its line and letter-spacing, and any spacing that there is between columns. A good example of styling with white space would be Skeleton.css. This is a great bootstrap for your site and focuses on offering spacing around your content effectively.

###Conclusion
Overall, I feel, now, that white space is essential in some site layouts as it supports a site visually, helping to promote users to focus more on certain aspects of the site, or guide them through a site, leading from one section to another. Another key role of white space is to make your site look clean and elegant, with beauty companies usually using white space to promote a sense of cleanliness.
