#Bad Website - The Chosen One
##Martins Music

###What is it?
The site I will be redesigning is a friends DJ site. It is pretty bland but most of all it is hard for the user to specifically find what they may be after.

I aim to make it look more consistent with keeping everything central on the page, hopefully making the user focus more on the main content. The main aim for the outcome of the site is to allow users to find the equipment they want for they’re function quickly and effectively.

There is a lot of information put on the home page which to a certain extent is pointless, and so I aim to reduce the amount of information on the page, only including the main details of the company, and using a read more button on some of the content to reduce the clutter.

Through using a lesser amount of content, it will make the users time quicker to find what they are looking for. For this site simplicity in finding what a users needs is key.

Again this is the homepage… Too much content!

###Price Page
The pricing page for the site is lacking functionality. I aim to add a button which allows a user to add the item to an enquiries section on the contact page. 

As you can see on the page, it is hard to keep looking along the name of the equipment and the prices, it takes unnecessary time. I will narrow this space up making it easier for a user to see the pricing and add it to enquiries.

###Moving Forward
From here I will start to use skeleton to create the functionality of the site and meet with the owner of the company allowing him to get an idea of how the site will be used. The site will be responsive and easy to use on mobile devices, reducing the clutter, making it more accessible for users.

If the functionality is successful and is appreciated then I can start to design it.

If however the functionality is not successful, I will redo the flow of the site, getting feedback off of the owner and a random user as to how they find the use and ease of finding the information they want.
