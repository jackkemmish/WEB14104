#Draw The Web

This is my drawing of the web. As you can see, it is a globe in the center of the page with numerous lines from country to country which portrays connectability between the areas. The arrows point to a cloud; this is another port of connectivity, allowing information to be stored, shared and recieved without taking up any storage on your system and can potentially be accessed anywhere. The other arrow points to a mobile device; this is the idea that nearly everyone now a days has access to such a device, be it young or old.
