        <p>1. Get the bread - I use brown and like to toast it on the 3rd setting.</p>
        <p>2. Once toasted, get the peanut butter and a spreadable knife and scoop out a large amount of peanut butter. Spread this large dollop of nut butter onto one peice of the toast and spread evenly (don't be affraid to add more).</p>
        <p>3. On the other peice of toast, with the same knife, scoop out a resonably large amount of chocoalte spread (I prefer Nutella) and again spread evenly. Again I stress don't be affraid to add even more!</p>
        <p>4. Now that the main stages are complete, get the banana and slice it, placing the peices onto a piece of toast, then placing the other slice of toast on top with both spreads being on the inside.</p>
        <p>5. When the sandwich has been put together, make sure you slice it diagonally to make each of the peices triangles. Triangles are the best sandwiches to eat!</p>
        <b><p>6. Now eat and enjoy!</p></b>

##Naked HTML Revised 1
As you can see in this section I have changed the ingredients tag to an unordered list to allow a better layout of text.
             
	-        <p>1. Wholemeal bread</p>
	-        <p>2. Your choice of peanut butter</p>

	-        <p>4. A banana</p>
	-        <p>5. Spreading knife</p>
	-        <p>6. Toaster</p>

As you can see in this section, I have again changed this paragraph tag to an ordered list to promote the different steps within the recipe.

##Naked HTML Revised 2
In this section, I have changed the bodies background colour to complement the recipe more so.

I have edited the unordered list here to be able to be checked by a user once they have used or purchased the item making it easier to keep track on the ingredients you have.

     <ul>
	-        <li>Wholemeal bread</li>
	-        <li>Your choice of peanut butter</li>
	-        <li>Your choice of chocolate spread</li>
	-        <li>A banana</li>
	-        <li>Spreading knife</li>
	-        <li>Toaster</li>
