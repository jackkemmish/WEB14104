#WebDev - What Did I learn?
###What were my learning goals at the beginning of the unit?


In this unit, I aim to have 3 main goal that I am going to meet at the end of this unit. These goals will be as follows:

- I aim to gain a better knowledge of coding (CSS, HMTL, PHP and JavaScript) to allow me to create pleasing sites for a user.

- As a person, my aim is to be able to create successful and useable sites for an individual to aid advertisement over the web (i.e. freelance work).

- At the end of this unit, the site I will be redesigning will hopefully be successful towards the wireframe created during the design aspect.

####Why are these important to me?
These goals that I have set are _**important**_ to me as I wish to become a Freelancer in the future, and being able to meet deadlines on my own without a company to push me will prove challenging and I will have to learn to schedule my time a lot more effectively. As a student, these goals are important to me as I strive to get good feedback and get the grades that will stand me in good stead for the future.

####My Strengths and Weakensses
In terms of my _**strengths**_, I would say I have a basic to intermediate level of understanding of CSS and HTML coding due to multiple work experience placements at QVC and The Crocodile, allowing me to improve my knowledge under a pressured environment. Another _**strength**_ is that I have designed a few sites which had been given feedback by the companies I had worked for, allowing me to understand that is expected for a successful site. For my _**weaknesses**_ I would say that it is not having a great knowledge of PHP and time planning on my own, so I will need to use an app which allows me to time manage better. I would say I admire the individual who I worked with at The Crocodile as he had been working for various companies until he went to this company (The Crocodile) and had made his way up to be Head of Digital, meeting the clients and working closely with them.

####How will I meet my goals?
To be able _**to meet my goals**_, I will try to consistently practice using the code and looking through tutorials, adapting the information to help me create pleasing code for a site. Going through the different code step by step to allow me to break it down in an easier way to understand, allowing me to implement different style features etc. When learning, I am proud that I get involved in the subject as I have a keen interest in it, however I need to better my scheduling of getting work done on time to allow me enough time on a part of the unit I may need to spend more time on.

**In one word my intentions would be: _Freelance_.**

###What have I learned?
From undergoing this project, I have learned many new and useful skills that will help me in the future of this course and when I leave to start working. I can safely say that my HTML and CSS skills have increased dramatically, and I am a lot more confident when creating a site using these coding tools. I have found new ways to code a website, using different boilerplates/bootstraps to make your site more effective such as Skeleton.css, Font Awesome, Zurb's Foundation, and many more. The use of Skeleton.css for example has helped me greatly in my re-design for the bad website, letting me create it to be responsive for other screen sizes, and just generally keeping the site neat and clean for users to navigate.

Touching again on me wanting to develop my coding abilities, I have never previously used PHP until this course due to never needing to, however I wish I had as it allows no end of possibilities; especially when creating a site for Wordpress. Using PHP has allowed me to download my HTML/CSS site as a Wordpress theme using a simple selection of code. Being able to use PHP opens a world of opportunity when developing websites as, in terms of Wordpress, it allows a theme to be managed through Wordpress by someone else, not neccessarily having to go through all the code again.

I feel that I have learned the ability to create a site which is clean and simple for users to navigate, but most importantly, successful enough for a client to change bits of information wihtin the site themselves through the use of Custom Fields. Using Custom Fields was something very new to me, but it is something that I will swear by when creating a site for a client again. It allows a client to adjust sections of the site that have been linked to a Custom Field without having to use the developer all the time. It allows users to update content quickly and simply. 

Another key learning point for me was being able to use FileZilla to transfer all my local host files created through MAMP to a remote host, something I didnt have a clue how to do previously. I have only previously taken for granted a lecturer setting up a hosting platform for me reently, but being able to create my own now is much more beneficial. Then learning, once the local host files have been uploaded to the new remote server, how to migrate the updates successfully to the remote site. These techniques will be beneficial in helping me with my second learning goal and wanting to do some freelance work on the side.

###What obstacles have you found?/ How did you go about solving the problems you encountered?
During this project, I have come across many obstacles, some worse/harder than others to overcome, but nethertheless, I kept on trying until the obstacles had been overcome. Many of these obstacles were down to my basic knowledge of HTML/CSS and my lack of knowledge for PHP and JavaScript.

I feel my first main issue was implementing Skeleton.css into my sites styling. I have never used a bootsrap before, and learning the key features of it took me a little while to get my head around; all the different columns sizes and functions. However, once I took my time and concentrated more, styling my site to be responsive within the Skeleton.css boilerplate was getting a lot easier, and I had the potential to do a lot more design wise. 

My next obstacle was the transfer of local host to remote host. Once I set up my remote hosting platform, I struggled to connet to the host. I then tried an alternative method by using the hosts IP Address, and this had worked for me. From here, I also had issues uploading my sites theme from local host to remote, and it was giving me an error. I then found after a little bit of playing around with the remote host folders that I was uploading the theme to the wrong file, I did not click on the public_html folder properly. I should have been uploading the theme to the folder within that folder. Setting up the migration on Wordpress from then on was pretty simple, allowing me to update the local host theme offline, then uploading any newer source files through FileZilla, and migrating the theme again.

Furthermore, using the Custom Fields plug in at first proved to be quite tricky as it needed PHP coding, which as I stated earlier, I am not very confident with. However, I had superseded my expectations and was able to add Custom Fields to the specific sections of my site that needed them, such as Equipment Hire, Gallery and the Venues pages.

###What could you improve in your project?
From completing this project, there are numerous things I would change if I learned how to complete these improvements. First of all, I would like to make the contact form actually work on the pages. At the moment, these forms do not actually work, but I would like to learn the coding to allow these contact forms to email the person involved. I feel that without this contact form working, the whole idea of enquiries for equipment is at a loss. Another feature connected to this would be to add the functionality of selecting pieces of equipment and to be able to add them to an email for enquires.

Creating a hamburger menu for a more responsive layout when the screen size has gotten smaller is another important feature I want to improve. I feel that when the site is on a mobile device, the nav bar is too cluttered, and the whole idea of the site is to be well layed out and clean. This would be a big improvement I want to add as many people now a days view sites on their phone predominantly more that any other device.

Another improvement would be to add a function next to the equipment on offer from the company, allowing a user to have easier functionality of enquiring about products for users. This will be in the form of a plus button and adds to a formatted email.

###What do you intend to improve in your personal and professional skills?
I would say that for myself to improve, I would need to better my coding skills, meaning I will take my time over summer to complete a few short courses on aspects of coding and potentially have a work experience placement to understand what a real company would expect from me.

Another imporvement for me would be my time management. This is really important to keep on top of as in a real working environment, companies will not react well to you or work being late as it could mean a build up of work, or potentially a loss in clients if your time management is not up to scratch.
