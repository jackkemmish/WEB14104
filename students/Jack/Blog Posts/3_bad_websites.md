#Bad Websites

###Martins Music

I have chosen this site as it is one of my friends dads sites, and to me it would be fun to help create a new site to aid his adveritsment for the company/brand. It will be a challenge as I will have to go through creating a wireframe, new logo etc. and have to discuss his likes and dislikes for a potential new site.

However this site is particualarly bad as it is not very pleasing to the eye, having a very dull and boring black background on the pages. The logo is blury and distorted, not looking very appealing to potential clients. It seems to be a very basic site as the images seem to not have been blended in nicely, they have no style to them at all. It does have some pointless information in certain places with the potential to be cleaned up a lot more, using a much nicer/cleaner font and layout on the pages.

This site has a lot of content on the home page making it look very cluttered and uninteresting to read. Much of the information can be found on the different pages of the site and so the homepage doesn't need to be this content heavy. Yes this site needs to have a lot of content, needing to successfully show what they do but it can be cleaned up and organised a lot better.

It includes different languages on the site, however it does not include different font sizes like the previous site also which can be implemented where neccessary, as, particularly with this site, some of the text is quite small.

###Goetz Show & Times

It is obvious that by looking at this site the ease of use and finding information can be quite hard as it seems to be very cluttered and the amount of informaiton on the page is not very appealing through the design. The array of colours and layout isn't very appealing to scroll thorugh, potentially being visually inaccessable.
