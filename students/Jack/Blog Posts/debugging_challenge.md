#Debugging Challenge

First of all, I really enjoyed this challenge much more than the previous jQuery challenge as it was a lot harder but very rewarding upon completion. 

I started by reading through the text within the javascript area to understand what was expected of me. Once I had read all of this I started to add my JavaScript code to the section, erasing the challenges as I went along to keep track of what I had done. Throughout the challenge I found myself searching for ideas on how to do a function on google (in the words of a wise man, 'google is our friend'). Google helped me a lot as there are always numerous answers on a specific topic, mainly Stackoverflow being my saviour also.

I think the main thing I had to search for which I struggled with was displaying the new raised amount and then making the 'target smashed' paragraph appear. With this I used google, and once again my answer was found.

Throught this challenge, I came across a few obstacles, such as, in the previous paragraph, certain aspects of the code i.e. selecting the correct parts of the HTML to use within some of the JavaScript functions.

From this challenge, I have learnt to overcome obstacles and keep trying harder. Using google is a very beneficial tool for finding information to help your coding, and I have also slightly bettered but, still have a predominantly basic knowledge of JavaScript. Moving on from this, I will try my best in practising more JavaScript/jQuery over the summer to give myself a better advantage next year.
