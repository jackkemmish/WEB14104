#jQuery Challenge

I found this challenge to be relatively tricky. It took me a few tries to understand how some of these functions worked, but once I got my head round the basics I managed to complete the challenge. I found myself, like in the debugging challenge, using google a few times to help me understand how to call part of the code.

However, I thoroughly enjoyed this task once I have understood it!
