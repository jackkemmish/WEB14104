#My Learning Goals
-----

In this unit, I aim to have 3 main goal that I am going to meet at the end of this unit. These goals will be as follows:

- I aim to gain a better knowledge of coding (CSS, HMTL, PHP and JavaScript) to allow me to create pleasing sites for a user.

- As a person, my aim is to be able to create successful and useable sites for an individual to aid advertisement over the web (i.e. freelance work).

- At the end of this unit, the site I will be redesigning will hopefully be successful towards the wireframe created during the design aspect.

##Why are these important to me?
These goals that I have set are _**important**_ to me as I wish to become a Freelancer in the future, and being able to meet deadlines on my own without a company to push me will prove challenging and I will have to learn to schedule my time a lot more effectively. As a student, these goals are important to me as I strive to get good feedback and get the grades that will stand me in good stead for the future.

##My Strengths and Weakensses
In terms of my _**strengths**_, I would say I have a basic to intermediate level of understanding of CSS and HTML coding due to multiple work experience placements at QVC and The Crocodile, allowing me to improve my knowledge under a pressured environment. Another _**strength**_ is that I have designed a few sites which had been given feedback by the companies I had worked for, allowing me to understand that is expected for a successful site. For my _**weaknesses**_ I would say that it is not having a great knowledge of PHP and time planning on my own, so I will need to use an app which allows me to time manage better. I would say I admire the individual who I worked with at The Crocodile as he had been working for various companies until he went to this company (The Crocodile) and had made his way up to be Head of Digital, meeting the clients and working closely with them.

##How will I meet my goals?
To be able _**to meet my goals**_, I will try to consistently practice using the code and looking through tutorials, adapting the information to help me create pleasing code for a site. Going through the different code step by step to allow me to break it down in an easier way to understand, allowing me to implement different style features etc. When learning, I am proud that I get involved in the subject as I have a keen interest in it, however I need to better my scheduling of getting work done on time to allow me enough time on a part of the unit I may need to spend more time on.

**In one word my intentions would be: _Freelance_.**
